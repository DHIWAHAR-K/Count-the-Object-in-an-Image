# Object Counting using OpenCV

## Overview

This project focuses on counting objects in an image using the OpenCV library in Python. The Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to perform image processing, contour detection, and object counting. The goal is to provide a simple yet effective example of object counting using computer vision techniques.

## Project Structure

- `object_counting_opencv.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for image processing, contour detection, and object counting.
- `image.jpg`: Sample image for object counting.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `opencv-python`: OpenCV library for image processing.

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## Running the Project
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook object_counting_opencv.ipynb in a Jupyter environment.
Make sure to have the sample image image.jpg in the same directory as the notebook.
Follow the notebook steps for image processing, contour detection, and object counting.

## Object Counting
The project demonstrates how to use OpenCV for image processing and contour detection.
Objects are counted based on identified contours in the sample image.

## Customization
Replace the sample image with your own images for different object counting scenarios.
Experiment with various image processing techniques and parameters for improved accuracy.
